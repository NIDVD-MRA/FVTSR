# Design goals
One of the main objectives of the code is to establish a relationship between fluorescence signal intensity and target sequence replication rate.
Improve the accuracy of nucleic acid test results for different samples and conditions by incorporating personalised parameters.
The ability to be universally applicable, robust and reliable under different testing conditions (e.g., different reagents, equipment, environment, etc.) has been considered.
